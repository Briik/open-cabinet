## **WebMD.com**

http://www.webmd.com/interaction-checker/default.htm

First impression:
High validity as WebMD but somewhat hard to use and not intuitive. Search is a bit odd in that you can “add” typos as medicine. For example, misspelling and searching for Azithromycin can result in a medicine addition. Finding the information for interactions and side effects takes some time exploring the website. Design is not attractive and advertisements are distracting.

Pros:
* High Validity  
* Extensive medicine library  
* Succinct explanation of interaction  

Cons:
* User interface/search can be confusing  
* Information for interactions hard to find  
* Typos can be added as medicines  

Recommendation for improvement:
* Improve user interface
* Make the search functionality more user friendly and foolproof
* Make design more attractive and updated.


## **Drugs.com**

http://www.drugs.com/drug_interactions.php# 

First impression:
Feels very commercial and somewhat outdated. However, the search has suggestions from typos. Like the WedMD.com interactions page, the advertisements are very distracting. User interface feels clunky and disjointed. The interactions are segmented so that piecing together the whole picture is difficult and takes some time.
Pros:
* Suggestions from typo searches
* A lot of information provided

Cons:
* Information is disjointed and hard to piece together
* Adding and removing drugs is not very easy due to interface

Recommendation for improvement:
* Have more relevant information readily available
* More importantly, make the interface more intuitive in adding and especially removing medicines from the list.


## **RXList.com**

http://www.rxlist.com/drug-interaction-checker.htm

First impression:
Not sure how exactly to use the site. Adding multiple medicines does give you a quick notice of how many interactions are present but you must do multiple drug searches and then submit to check for interactions. Interface and design is not very user friendly.

Pros:
* Easy to tell severity of interactions

Cons:
* Will change the medicine name to chemical name (e.g. “Advil Allergy” = “Chlorphen-pseudoeph-ibuprofen”) so it’s hard to keep track at times.
* Digging deeper into the information becomes very difficult. Something as simple as ibuprofen will show dozens of different brand names and variations. 

## **Epocrates App**

First impression:
Must create an account to sign-in. Account asks for a lot of personal information and it looks like the app is geared towards medical professionals.

Pros:
* Mobile app
* Categorized medicines by types (e.g. analgesics, anesthesia, antimicrobials)
* Concise information on interactions

Cons:
* Very long log-in process
* Not ideal as a quick reference because of a variety of purposes

Recommendation for improvement:
* Not a bad app, however, it is very focused on medical professionals. 
* It also has many other features built in such as looking up doctors and looking up pills by shape/color that give it a messy and disorganized design and interface feel.

## **Other competitors:**
_MayoClinic.org_  
Site has more information about diseases and conditions, and the information is displayed in a way it highlights just one drug. You must read pages of information to understand the interactions and adverse effects. However, it does have a list of all interacting medicines. It is just not plausible to go through that much information to find a pair interaction.

_AMDA.com_  
Site focuses too much on geriatric care. Too focused to have wide market appeal. Interface and design feels very outdated.

_MediGuard.org_  
Mobile App  App only allows a few searches free before you are forced to buy the app. It does have an added benefit of being able to add in medical conditions that the user may have. Interface again looks very outdated, sterile, and no very user friendly.

_Healthtools.aarp.org/drug-interactions_  
Useful as a quick reference but it lists all known interactions of the searched drug. Another drug can be added specifically to check for interactions but the list of all known interactions remains. User has to scroll through until he/she finds the two drugs of interest.
