## Round 4 Usability Testing with Desktop & Tablet Application (v2)

**Key Insights:**  
1. Users don't know why they would come to OpenCabinet and want more content telling them what it's for. They also want to know why they should create an account or sign in. What are the benefits?  
2. Users like type-ahead functionality, but it has room for improvements (e.g. to help with spelling and to filter for most frequently searched for medicines first).  
3. When users select drugs that interact with one another, they want a clear indication that there are 0 interactions.  
4. Users don't notice the visual representation of interactions on the left.  
5. Users don't understand why interactions are uni-directional (if they click Drug A and it says it interacts with Drug B, but when they click Drug B, it doesn't show an interaction with Drug A).  

**Key Outcomes:**
1. We added an "About" section with information about OpenCabinet and FAQ section, which includes information about the benefits of creating an account (number 1 above).  
2. We added the number of interactions, along with an exclamation mark in the corner of the medicines, alerting users to drugs that interact with one another (number 4 above).  
3. Made interactions bi-directional, such that if Drug A and Drug B show an interaction, then it will also show an interaction between Drug B and Drug A.
