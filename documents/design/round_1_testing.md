## Round 1 Usability Testing with Version 1 Mockups  

**_Key Insights:_**  
1. Users liked the color scheme. They found it modern, approachable, and thought the high contrast made different items easy to see.  
2. Users liked the "cabinet" layout over the "tile/list" layout.  
3. Users wanted the ability to sign-in to save medicines and searches, but also wanted to be able to proceed as an anonymous guest.

**_Outcomes:_**  
1. Kept the color scheme predominantly the same, but changed the orange to red for interaction and "warning" cues.  
2. Proceeded with cabinet layout option, since it was unanimously favored over the other tile/list option.  
3. Continued to allow users to create an account and have their information saved, or proceed as a guest, and not have their information saved past the first session.
