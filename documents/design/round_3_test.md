## Round 3 Usability Testing with Desktop Application (v1)

**Key Insights:**  
1. Overall, customers know how to interact with the site and like the functionality. At this point we've fixed the major functional usability issues.  
2. Users provided feedback that the email field in the sign in box was automatically activated, os you can't tell that it's looking for an email address unless you tab through to another field (they think it's just asking for any type of username and if they don't include an email address they get an error).  
3. Users want additional information about what the site is and what the purpose is. The landing page should have more content, or the navigation could include an "about" page showing these details.  
4. Users want additional content on cabinet page with explicit instructions telling them what to do
5. Users are confused by the visual representation of interactions.   

**Key Outcomes:**  
1. Most of these issues (numbers 3-5 above) were addressed in code released after Round 4 of usability testing (see notes below).  
2. Developers did a code refactor to enhance the interaction calculations on the backend.  
3. Automatic activation of email field in sign in box was removed (number 2 above).
