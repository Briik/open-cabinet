**Introduction**

The OpenCabinet style guide was created to produce visually consistent information across the application. It contains guidance on how to use typography, color, and address visual elements in the application.

**Icons**

Pill bottle icons add visual interest to the page and allow opencabi.net users to make a visual connection to their medicine cabinet. The skeuomorphic imagery allows for a greater degree of personal connection between the user and their saved medicine cabinet.

**Typography**

Lato is a modern, sans-serif typeface with classic proportions that give the letterforms harmony and elegance. The typeface was chosen for its semi-rounded details, giving words a feeling of warmth while retaining a strong structure. Lato is legible at both small and large sizes, making it an ideal typeface for OpenCabinet.

**Colors**

The color palette consists primarily of neutral and cool colors in shades of gray, blue, and green. These colors are commonly found in hospitals and professional medical offices that promote calmness. The bright blue and green give the application a modern feel by adding touches of vibrance.

Red should be used discriminately to guide user attention to specific, but important actions and information. 

The secondary color is designed to promote the primary colors and is subordinate to the primary colors. The cool, dark blue is meant to play a supporting role and should never be used in a way that overpowers the primary colors.
