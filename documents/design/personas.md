# Personas
## 19 June 2015

After the team performed initial user research, we used that data to begin brainstorming who our primary customers might be, why they might want to use Open Cabinet, and how they would want to interact with our website. We documented these archetypes and shared them with the team using Personas, and referenced them when making decisions about design and functionality. We chose one key persona to include in our [Short-Form Creative Brief](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/wiki/Design:-Creative-Brief) to help the team envision a potential user who would benefit from our finalized product.
