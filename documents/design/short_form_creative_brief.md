# Short-Form Creative Brief

**Project Objective:** Build a web application that allows customers to determine if medications a person is taking can interact with one another in potentially harmful ways and to find information that allows him or her to make an informed decision about what medications to take.

**Key Persona:** Betty Joe – a 58-year old librarian who was diagnosed with a thyroid condition six months ago. She is single, so she is the only person that takes the medication in her cabinet. 

**Key Scenario:** In addition to her thyroid condition, Betty is on allergy medication and wants to start taking a multivitamin. She needs to determine what other medications and vitamins she can take that won’t harmfully interact with her thyroid medicine.

**Key Principles:** Simplicity and Ease of Use over Comprehensive Features – The design should provide a simple and straight-forward user experience so users can quickly and easily determine when adding a new medicine to their regimen may have harmful effects.
