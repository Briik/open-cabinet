# Product Tree

The Product Owner met with key members of the team early in the project to create a [Product Tree](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/issues/102). The purpose of the Product Tree was to define a prioritized list of Initial Features and Product Enhancements that Open Cabinet would provide to the market in three general stages: 1) Minimal Viable Product (MVP), 2) First Iteration Enhancements, and 3) Second Iteration Enhancements. 
The tree was then shared with the team as a way to clearly communicate the high-level priorities and goals for each stage of release so they could concretely envision the product outcome.

Initial tree pruning focused around four key features:  
1) Customer Account  
2) Medicine Search  
3) Adding Medicines to Medicine Cabinet  
4) Showing Interactions Among Medicines in Medicine Cabinet  

These features were identified during our first round of ethnographic studies, when we met with potential users and asked them about the features and functionality they would like to have. As the project expands, and additional research dictates the need for additional functionality, those would be added to the Product Tree as a roadmap for future enhancements.
