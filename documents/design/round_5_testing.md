## Round 5 Usability Testing with Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile Application (v3)

**Key Insights:**  
1. Unanimously, users preferred the original cabinet to all other features  
2. Users like that we are trying to show a graphic with the visualization feature, but they don't understand it  
3. Users didn't understand why you couldn't click the "home" button if you were logged in   
4. Users still don't understand why they should log in. They note that it's an obvious goal since the login box is so prominent on the landing page, but they aren't sure what the benefits of singing up are.  
5. Users want an explicit notification when no drugs in their cabinet interact with one another.  
6. Mobile: Users didn't find deleting drugs on mobile view intuitive  
7. Mobile: If a medicine in their cabinet has an interaction, it is impossible to delete it because clicking on the medicine took them to information about it  
8. Tablet: With the alternative cabinet feature, you have to click medicines twice in order to delete them  

**Key Outcomes:**  
1. We decided to release the cabinet with the original cabinet view (number 1 above)  
2. Removed "home" button from logged in view. Users can still get back to the page by logging out or clicking "Open Cabinet" (number 3 above)  
3. Added text letting them know why they should create an account in the login box (number 4 above)  
4. Added a notification when there are no drugs interacting with the selected drug in their cabinet (number 5 above)  
5. Removed bottle images on mobile to add in a trashcan instead for intuitive delete (numbers 6 & 7 above)  
6. Numerous bug fixes identified in usability testing
