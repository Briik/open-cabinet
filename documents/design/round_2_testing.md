## Round 2 Usability Testing with Version 2 Desktop Mockups

**_Key Insights:_**  
1. Users are confused by the navigation  
2. Users don't understand the "pointing fingers" or red arrows  
3. Users are confused by the redundancy of the search bar and "add new" plus sign and aren't sure how these would be combined into one search experience  
4. Users like the simple, straightforward design and general look-and-feel!  
5. Users don't understand the "clear all" button. Does it clear the interaction data or does it actually delete all the medicines in their cabinet? They are fearful of the latter.  
6. Users don't understand why the "add new" button disappears after you've added a medicine to your cabinet.  
7. Users don't know how to get back to the cabinet from the interactions page.  

**_Outcomes:_**   
1. Navigation tab titles were changed for greater clarity (number 1 above)  
2. Pointing fingers were removed from the page, the red arrow in the search was replaced by a "plus sign" and red arrows are now only being used to tell a user when they should click something and see the next page of information. (number 2 above)  
3. The "plus sign" indicating "add new" functionality was moved into the search bar. This accommodates the confusion described in numbers 3 and 6 above as it now appears regardless of how many medicines are in the cabinet.  
4. We removed the "clear all" button as it was confusing users. The delete functionality is simple and straightforward, and can only be done one medicine at a time. Users have not provided feedback that clearing their cabinet all at once is a desired functionality (number 5 above)  
5. Added a back button on the interactions page (number 7 above)
