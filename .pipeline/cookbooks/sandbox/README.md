This cookbook is basically a rails cookbook that lays down various configuration for the "sandbox" application.
 
It is basically a copied/pasted version of other myuscis application cookbooks (really need to merge these!)

At a high level, this takes care of:

 1. Lays down new relic configuration
 2. Lays down secrets
 3. Lays down environment variables
 4. Lays down some nginx configuraiton
 5. Runs the Rails rake deployment tasks
